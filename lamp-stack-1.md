# **WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LAMP STACK) IN AWS**

This Project covers the implementation of developing a boilerplate LAMP Stack app from start to finish and deploying to **AWS** (Amazon Web Services). The LAMP Stack is a Technology Stack. A Technology stack comprises of framework/tools that are used in building a software application. The LAMP Acronym stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP.

- Linux - It is an operating system that is free and open source, and was built from UNIX. We would be creating our AWS EC2 instance on a Linux Virtual Server.

- Apache - Apache is a very popular web server software that is used for hosting applications

- MySQL - It is a Database management system that is used for storing data in form of tables(rows, columns). It is a relational database and data must be stored in a structured format.

- PHP - PHP is a modern server side languauge that is used for building web applications.

Let's get started with implementing the LAMP Stack and deploying to AWS.
